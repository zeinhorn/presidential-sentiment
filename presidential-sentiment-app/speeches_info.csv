"2","October 26, 2020","President Trump presides over the swearing-in ceremony for Justice Amy Coney Barrett as she becomes an associate justice of the US Supreme Court. She is only the fifth woman to become a Supreme Court justice. Barrett's nomination and confirmation was controversial as Republicans in 2016 refused to consider President Obama's nomination to the Supreme Court after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, claiming it was too close the November presidential election. But when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg died in September, the Republicans pushed through her confirmation, and President Trump swore her in just a week before the 2020 presidential election.Â ",2.59375
